# SOC Investigations Simulations

This folder contains hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation simulations. Each file documents alert triage, investigation steps, analysis, and resolution for simulated incidents. These exercises were completed in the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 path and other controlled lab environments.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate incident response skills, including monitoring, triaging, and resolving alerts.
- Document investigations using SOC-style case reporting.
- Capture lessons learned and best practices for security operations.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- SIEM / Log Analysis: Splunk Enterprise, Wazuh  
- Alert Monitoring: Alert queues, dashboards  
- Network Analysis: Packet capture, log correlation  
- Playbooks: Standard operating procedures for alert investigation  

## Completed Simulations

- [Incident Simulation: Blocked Malicious Website Access](./Incident-Simulation-Blocked-Malicious-Website.md)  
  TryHackMe Introduction to Phishing. Investigated firewall-blocked malicious URL access, identified IOCs, and documented findings.

> Additional investigations will be added as I progress through TryHackMe and other labs.

## Notes

- All simulations are **controlled lab environments**; results are documented to reflect professional SOC processes.  
- Each investigation follows a structured incident report format including: Summary, Investigation Steps, Findings, Resolution, and Lessons Learned.
