# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio – AworkofKC
Hands-on practice, learning notes, and projects focused on threat detection and foundational cybersecurity skills.


# 👩🏽‍💻 About Me
I’m KC — aka @AworkofKC — an analytical mind with a creative heart. With a background in administrative and call center environments, I bring strong communication, organization, and meticulous attention to detail into my cybersecurity journey. I’m currently focused on learning threat detection, digital privacy, and core security principles through labs and self-guided study. This portfolio reflects my hands-on practice, learning exercises, and evolving understanding of the field.

---

Welcome! I'm building hands-on cybersecurity skills to detect, analyze, and respond to digital threats. Passionate about SOC operations, network monitoring, and automating security workflows.


## 🧠 Areas of Focus / Interest

- **SOC & Security Operations**  
  Monitoring and analyzing alerts, triaging incidents, and improving operational efficiency.

- **Incident Response & Digital Forensics**  
  Investigating suspicious activity using packet captures, log analysis, and evidence-based response.

- **Threat Detection & Vulnerability Management**  
  Identifying potential risks, analyzing vulnerabilities, and applying mitigation strategies to strengthen defenses.

- **Automation in Security**  
  Developing scripts and tools that streamline alert handling, reduce false positives, and enhance detection accuracy.

- **Networking & Protocols**  
  Deep understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, and network traffic behavior for better visibility and detection insight.
  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I'm Learning

- **SIEM & Log Analysis:** Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic Stack
- **Packet & Network Analysis:** Wireshark, basic Nmap scanning
- **Scripting & Automation:** Python, Bash
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), Windows basics
- **Data & Querying:** SQL for log queries and event correlation

## 🕵️‍♀️ SOC Investigation Simulations

## ✍️ Independent Projects

- Hands-on SQL activity practicing `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` filters — completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

- I created a cybersecurity cheat sheet to document what I’ve learned throughout the year from research, studies, and courses. It’s used as a quick reference for commonly used Linux commands, Python snippets, SQL queries, network capture commands (Wireshark, TCPDump), and practical examples. This is a living document that I continuously update as I learn through practice and other research.

- As an aspiring SOC Analyst and Incident Responder, I am currently building my skills through hands-on experimentation and self-guided research. My journey is rooted in trial, error, and documentation—capturing both technical wins and the messy process behind them. I’ve been exploring open-source tools like Security Onion in a VirtualBox lab to simulate real-world monitoring and incident response workflows. This journal reflects my reasoning and learning opportunities as I explore what it means to think and act like an SOC Analyst.
