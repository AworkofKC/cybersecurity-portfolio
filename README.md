# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio – AworkofKC
Hands-on practice, learning notes, and projects focused on threat detection and foundational cybersecurity skills.


# 👩🏽‍💻 About Me
I’m KC — aka @AworkofKC — an analytical mind with a creative heart. With a background in administrative and call center environments, I bring strong communication, organization, and meticulous attention to detail into my cybersecurity journey. I’m currently focused on learning threat detection, digital privacy, and core security principles through labs and self-guided study. This portfolio reflects my hands-on practice, learning exercises, and evolving understanding of the field.

---

Welcome! I'm building hands-on cybersecurity skills to detect, analyze, and respond to digital threats. Passionate about SOC operations, network monitoring, and automating security workflows.


## 🧐 Areas of Focus / Interest

- **SOC & Security Operations** – Monitoring alerts, analyzing logs, and triaging incidents
- **Incident Response & Digital Forensics** – Investigating suspicious activity, packet captures, and log-based analysis
- **Threat Detection & Vulnerability Management** – Identifying potential risks, analyzing vulnerabilities, and understanding mitigation strategies
- **Automation in Security** – Scripting and tools to streamline alert analysis and threat detection
- **Networking & Protocols** – TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, and network traffic inspection

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I'm Learning

- **SIEM & Log Analysis:** Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic Stack
- **Packet & Network Analysis:** Wireshark, basic Nmap scanning
- **Scripting & Automation:** Python, Bash
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), Windows basics
- **Data & Querying:** SQL for log queries and event correlation



## 📖 Coursework/Certifications

**Google Cybersecurity Certificate** -  ✅Completed Aug 2025  
**CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** – ✅Earned September 2025



## 🧠 Hands-On Practice/ Learning Tools

- Hands-on SQL activity practicing `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` filters — completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

- I created a cybersecurity cheat sheet to document what I’ve learned throughout the year from research, studies, and courses. It’s used as a quick reference for commonly used Linux commands, Python snippets, SQL queries, network capture commands (Wireshark,TCPDump), and practical examples. This is a living document that I continuously update as I learn through practice and other research.

- As an aspiring SOC Analyst and Incident Responder, I am currently building my skills through hands-on experimentation and self-guided research. My journey is rooted in trial, error, and documentation—capturing both technical wins and the messy process behind them. I’ve been exploring open-source tools like Security Onion in a VirtualBox lab to simulate real-world monitoring and incident response workflows. This journal reflects my reasoning and learning opportunities as I explore what it means to think and act like an SOC Analyst.

## Professional Statement:
With a creative and administrative background, I’m now building a cybersecurity career focused on threat detection, incident response, and system defense. I’m committed to developing the technical skills needed to protect digital environments, while also bringing strong communication and problem-solving to every challenge. My goal is to help teams respond confidently to cyber threats and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world.
