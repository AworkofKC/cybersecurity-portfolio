- I created a cybersecurity cheat sheet to document what I’ve learned throughout the year from research, studies, and courses. It’s used as a quick reference for commonly used Linux commands, Python snippets, SQL queries, network capture commands (Wireshark, TCPDump), and practical examples. This is a living document that I continuously update as I learn through practice and other research.

- As an aspiring SOC Analyst and Incident Responder, I am currently building my skills through hands-on experimentation and self-guided research. My journey is rooted in trial, error, and documentation—capturing both technical wins and the messy process behind them. I’ve been exploring open-source tools like Security Onion in a VirtualBox lab to simulate real-world monitoring and incident response workflows. This journal reflects my reasoning and learning opportunities as I explore what it means to think and act like an SOC Analyst.

## Professional Statement:
With a creative and administrative background, I’m now building a cybersecurity career focused on threat detection, incident response, and system defense. I’m committed to developing the technical skills needed to protect digital environments, while also bringing strong communication and problem-solving to every challenge. My goal is to help teams respond confidently to cyber threats and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world.
